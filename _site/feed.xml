&lt;h2 id=&quot;but&quot;&gt;but&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I learned to use Jekyll to set up a blog site, and GitHub’s use!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-idea&quot;&gt;an idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An idea came to me, although the blog site is set up, it don’t be used to do something, because I usually write blog at CSDN.After all, CSDN is the technology blog, it can not upload all things, so I decided to write blogs which are not technology blogs at the site, for example diary…&lt;/p&gt;
