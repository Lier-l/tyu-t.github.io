&lt;h3 id=&quot;number-theory&quot;&gt;number theory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number theory is my weekness, such as unique decomposition theorem, Euler theorem, I can not use them skillfully. So I decided to spend more time to study number theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novel voronavious has been out of control, the number of confirmed patients is 333076, and the number increase 40832 just today!

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but&quot;&gt;but&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I learned to use Jekyll to set up a blog site, and GitHub’s use!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-idea&quot;&gt;an idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An idea came to me, although the blog site is set up, it don’t be used to do something, because I usually write blogs at CSDN.After all, CSDN is the technology blog, it can not upload all things, so I decided to write blogs which are not technology blogs at the site, for example diary…&lt;/p&gt;
