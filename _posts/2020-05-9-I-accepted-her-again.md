## I accepted her again

I accepted her again after she persuaded me all night. I turned her down at first, but when I think about it carefully, it seems that I misunderstood her. If she really wanted to break up, how could her never let me go. I used to think that as long as two persons like each other, they can definitely go to the end. I do not know when I changed my mind. But she has the same idea as I used to have! She said, "as long as you like me, we can go on". I guess that maybe I can try again. How can I refuse someone who likes me and I like her.

## Am I really wrong

Am I really wrong? I find that I often misunderstand others recently. I know it is because I have a strong defense mechanism. I have always been, especially academically.
