## living with my aunt

I have been living in my aunt's house for 30 days and my cousin(my aunt's daughter) also lives here. My cousin has a son named hjl. My cousin scolds her son almost every day. Since I came here, I haven not seen my cousin praise her son once! All I can hear is endless reprimands.

## my cousin

My cousin is 30 years old and has been married for about 10 years. It is really bad for her to get married because her husband is very disheartening and not nice to her. Frequent mental breakdown led her mental illness. My cousin behaves normally when she is with anyone, but when she is with someone related her husband and she often gets out of control, including her son!

## my cousin's son

The child is 9 years old and mischievous. Unfortunately, a few days ago, my cousin's son was found out to be abnormal. Although he often made trouble for me, I really feel sorry for him.

## my cousin scolded her son again

My cousin scolded her son again today, and her tone was more ferocious than ever. She even said she wanted her son to die! I do not want to live here at all. I like my cousin, but I do not like the environment. I am going to leave in a few days and go home to live by myself.
