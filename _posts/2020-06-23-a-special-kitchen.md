## same as before

Same as before, I live with my aunt. But there is one thing impresses me is my aunt's kitchen. The style of the kitchen is still the same same of that my grandma's. Cooking depends on firewood however there is a electric rice cooker. The environment is simple and there are many flies. I can not even find a metal cleaning ball when I brush the pot. My aunt only use a loofah to brush the pot.

## an attractive thing

An attractive thing happened today. When I was doing a question, a strong fragrance pulled me back from my thinking. I found my aunt was making soup, a stew of fish head soup. The soup is so delicious that I can not wait for it to stew. I think it is the second best soup I have ever had and I had two bowls! Even now, I have had a  lot of aftertaste for that soup. I have a completely new appraisal of that kitchen.
