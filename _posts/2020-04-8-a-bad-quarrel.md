## a quarrel
A quarrel broke out between me and my mom. She is so lazy that she just goes shopping every day, even my little brother and I do not eat. And she said:"Am I your nanny?"

## it does not matter
It does not matter, I can cook for my brother and me, too. But I can not stand the fact that I have to cook when I should have been in class.

## i feel the deep malice from life
I feel the deep malice from life. I do not like myself a little now.
