## learning
Learning requires skills, but I found that many people just shouted slogans and did not give practical actions or only have a moment's drive and continue to sink the next day. I blurting out this is not just a one-time fancy. I have seen many people talk a lot about ideals, however their grades did not go up as I expected. I think about the reasons many times. I think the key is executive force.

## a special friend
A special friend is facing the same trouble. I am just a observer who wants to know what is going to happen. It should be noted that she was not my special friend just a few days ago, but my girl friend. She said that she needed to study hard and would not hesitate to break up with me in exchange for study time. It is funny that today she did not do her homework because she played with her dog.I would like to see how hard she studies.
