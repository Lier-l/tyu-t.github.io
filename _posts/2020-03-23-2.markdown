## nothing

Today I did nothing, did not study, did not listen to class and did not review what.

## but

But I learned to use Jekyll to set up a blog site, and GitHub's use!


## a idea

I suddenly wonder, although the blog site is set up, it don't be used to do something, because I usually write blog at CSDN.After all, CSDN is the technology blog, it can not upload all things, so I decided to write blogs which are not technology blogs at the site, for example diary...

I suddenly wonder again, I decided to use it as a English diary platform.

Do what you say, so it is why it is here.

Today is the first day, I don't write too much, The so-called"one spirit, then decline,three exhausts".

Come on, Oligei!!
