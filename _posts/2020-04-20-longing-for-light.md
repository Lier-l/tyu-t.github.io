## xxl

XXL was one of my best friends when I was in high school. Unluckily, his eyes were congenital myopia which caused his eyesight to be much weaker than that of ordinary people. But he was optimistic about the facts.

## the disaster came suddenly

The disaster came suddenly. His eyesight degenerated rapidly in half a day! He was fine just a few hours ago...

## it shocked me deeply

It shocked me deeply, even though I had just heard about the collapse of the US oil market. He was my source of happiness. I believe that miracles can only happen to extraordinary people and he will do wonders!
