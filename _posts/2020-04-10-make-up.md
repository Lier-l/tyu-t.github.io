## she did talk to me as expected
She did talk to me as expected. "Can we make up?".What? This really shocked me. Compared with the unfelling feeling 10 days ago, this sentence is quite different.
## I want to make up, too
I want to make up, too. Because I love her, I guess. Although I think she will abandon me again one day in the future.
## awkward atmosphere
Awkward atmosphere is fatal. She still is angry with me because of mea culpa. But it is her who wants to break up, and it is her who wants to make up, and now it is also her who is angry with me. Why she wants to make up since she still is angry with me? I do not know how to do.
