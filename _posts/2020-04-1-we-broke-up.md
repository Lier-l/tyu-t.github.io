## we broke up
We broke up today. It is 215 days since we were together. The reason for breaking up is simple--I do not have time for her. But I did my best. Now my life is in a mess, it is all about her in my brain. For the first time, I get the feeling of losing my love.

## ironically
Ironically, I broke up at April Fools' Day. I won't fall in love again, at least for a long time to come.
