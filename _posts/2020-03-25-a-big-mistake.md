### a big mistake

A big mistake is made by me today--I exchanged my homework with Wang Sijie's homework accidentally! But the reason is forgivable. I help her to change the format of her homework because of her broken computer, but I exchanged them during handing in them accidentally. Fortunately I did not exchanged another classmate's homework, otherwise it will be a big disaster.

It is OK, I do not care the little score, and I feel lucky because her score is higher than mine because of my homework. That make me have less sense of guilt. 

### my feet

My feet hurt three days ago, but it still hurts today. Due to I do not have a lot time today, so if it still hurts tomorrow, I will go to the hospital.
