I"+<h2 id="nothing">nothing</h2>

<p>Today I did nothing,did not study,did not listen to class and did not review what.</p>

<h2 id="but">but</h2>

<p>But I learned to use Jekyll to set up a blog site, and GitHub’s use!</p>

<h2 id="a-idea">a idea</h2>

<p>I suddenly wonder,although the blog site is set up,it don’t be used to do something,because I usually write blog at CSDN.After all,CSDN is the technology blog,it can not upload all thing,so I decided to write blogs which are not technology blogs at the site,for example diary…</p>

<p>I suddenly wonder again,I decided to use it as a English diary platform.</p>

<p>Do what you say,so it is why it is here.</p>

<p>Today is the first day,I don’t write too much,The so-called”one spirit,then decline,three exhausts”.</p>

<p>Come on,Oligei!!</p>
